# Biography

I hold a PhD in Information and Communication Technologies from Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Spain) and a Master's in Systems and Computer Engineering from the National University of Colombia. My research is primarily focused on leveraging technology to enhance education, with a special emphasis on measuring its impact through Learning Analytics. Over the years, I have developed a deep passion for exploring how data-driven insights can transform educational practices and improve student outcomes.

Since 2013, I have been actively involved in mobile application development, specializing in both Android and cross-platform solutions. As an entrepreneur and freelancer, I have had the opportunity to create innovative applications for a wide range of sectors, gaining experience in project management, user experience design, and adapting technology to solve real-world problems. This diverse background has strengthened my ability to bridge the gap between technical expertise and practical application, especially within educational settings.
